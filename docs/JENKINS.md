on local laptop to manage kubernetes cluster from single laptop.

Setup Guide for Jenkins and Kubernetes, and Kubespere on a Local Laptop:

**Prerequisites:**

*   Install Docker Desktop on your local laptop with Kubernetes enabled.
*   Install a compatible version of Java on your local laptop.
*   Have a compatible version of Git installed.
*   For Jenkins, it is recommended to have at least 8 GB RAM available for a standard installation.

**Step 1: Installing Docker Desktop with Kubernetes**

To install Docker Desktop on your laptop and enable Kubernetes:

1.  Download and install Docker Desktop from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
2.  Follow the installation instructions provided.
3.  After installing Docker Desktop, enable Kubernetes by following these steps:
    *   Open Docker Desktop.
    *   Click on the "Troubleshoot" or "Settings" icon.
    *   Go to the "Kubernetes" tab.
    *   Check the box next to "Enable Kubernetes."
    *   Click on the "Apply & Restart" button to apply the changes.

**Step 2: Installing Jenkins**

To install Jenkins on your local laptop:

1.  Open Docker Desktop.
2.  Open a terminal and run the following Docker command to download and install Jenkins:

```
docker run -u 0 --name myjenkins -p 8080:8080 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v $(pwd)/jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts
```
3.  Wait for Jenkins to finish downloading and installing.
4.  Open a web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) to access the Jenkins web interface.

**Step 3: Installing Kubespere**

Kubespere, also known as Kubernetes Dashboard or K3s is not necessary for kubernetes as you can use any other client like Lens to connect to kubernetes to which you can get download instructions from here: [https://k8slens.dev/](https://k8slens.dev/)

However if you like the command way try below.

But that being said, you can setup a kubernetes dashboard by below ways.

1.  First of all deploy kubernetes-dashboard in a namespace by this command:

```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.5.0-rc.1/aio/deploy/recommended/kubernetes-dashboard.yaml
```
    You will need to enable the ingress, enabling ingress service can be complex you can alternatively be accessing same without exposing the service to the outside world through below commands.

```bash
    kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard port-forward svc/kubernetes-dashboard 9090:80 &
```
2.  Now you will be able to connect through port-forward.

**Step 4: Connect to the Kubernetes Cluster in Jenkins**

1.  Install the Kubernetes plugin in Jenkins.
    *   Go to the "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins" > "Available" tab.
    *   Search for "Kubernetes" and check the box next to it.
    *   Click on the "Download now and install after restart" button.
2.  Restart Jenkins.
3.  Configure the Kubernetes plugin in Jenkins.
    *   Go to the "Manage Jenkins" > "Configure System" page.
    *   Scroll down to the "Cloud" section.
    *   Check the box next to "Kubernetes."
    *   Fill in the details for your Kubernetes cluster.
4.  Save the configuration changes.

**Using Jenkins and Kubernetes**

1.  Create a new Jenkins job.
2.  Configure the job to use the Kubernetes plugin.
    *   Go to the job configuration page.
    *   Scroll down to the "Build Environment" section.
    *   Check the box next to "Deploy to Kubernetes."
    *   Fill in the details for your Kubernetes cluster.
3.  Save the configuration changes.
4.  Run the job.

Kubernetes will now be used as the build agent for the Jenkins job. Jenkins will create a new pod in the Kubernetes cluster for each build.

Please follow all of these steps and you should have Jenkins, Kubernetes, and Kubespere up and running on your local laptop.
